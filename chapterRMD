# Introduction
```{r}
setwd("C:/Users/pprzystupa/Documents/Spring_2017/SAA_2017")
```

# Import the data into R

```{r}
child = read.csv("Combined_Orph_NA_data.csv")
```

# Exploratory data analysis

I wanted to just look at the data together and see what the relationship to time was so I did a basic scatter plot

```{r}
boxplot(child$Distance_KM, horizontal = TRUE)
hist(child$Distance_KM, breaks = 20, col = "navy", main = "Histogram of Children's institution distribution")
```

It looks like there are some outliers making it hard to look at the distribution of this data. So lets get rid of those for now by making a new grouping of data that only looks at the institutions that are closer than 100 KM to an urban area. R puts dots as the outliers which are defined as X now to rerun it
```{r}
child_no = subset(child, child$Distance_KM < 100)
```
Now having removed all those outliers we can plot the data again 

```{r}
hist(child_no$Distance_KM, breaks = 20, col = "navy", main = "Histogram of Children's institution distribution")
```
Still looks like there's a lot of variation but the majority of sites are under 5 KM from an urban area

```{r}
plot(Distance_KM ~ Year, 
     data = child)
```

It doesn't look like a particularly strong trend but I can test this by fitting a linear regression model to see what is going on with my data using:

```{r}
child.lm = lm(Distance_KM ~ Year, 
           data = child)
summary(child.lm)
```

This creates a linear regression of the dependent variable, distance in kilometers, to the independent variable time, as stated in years, and provides me with the coefficients for the intercept, which is listed under the Estimate and (intercept), and slope, which is the estimate under the year, as well as the R-squared values. R squared is a metric that allows us to understand how well the linear regression model explains our data. The call for linear model lm() includes two types of R squared, multiple and adjusted. It looks like for this case the multiple R-squared, or just R-squared, is .005 which means that only about half a percent of the data is predicted by our model. The adjusted R-squared includes the number of points used to create the model. Essentially it examines how meaningful the R is based on the n of your sample. This is so you can compare the strength of different models with different samples used to calculate them. It can go up or down depending on the sample. In this case, the adjusted-R squared does not improve when we adjust for the size of the sample. Lastly, the p-value, which is the liklihood that this is random, is nowhere near significant. So the combination of the p-value and my rather unhelpful R-squared values suggests there's limited explanatory value in a linear regression for this sample combined sample.

# Residuals
While I'm here I'll also plot the residuals for the data set overall to see if there are any trends with those, which may alter my choice in data set or the methods I should apply to it. 

```{r}
child.res = resid(child.lm)
plot(child$Year, child.res)
abline(h = 0, col = "red")
summary(lm(child.res~child$Year))
```

Looking at the plot it doesn't appear that there is any trend in the residuals and further more it has a p-value of 1 suggesting it is completely random. Which is what we want. If there were at trend in the residuals we might be looking at much more complicated data set and other statistical analysis of the data.
# Boxplot the data
But I also want to look at this stuff as a boxplot; need to add a main and correct labels etc. and possibly remove outliers
```{r}
boxplot(child_no$Distance_KM~child_no$EL, horizontal = TRUE)
```
Separated out the data below
```{r}
early = subset(child, Year < 1900)
late = subset(child, Year <= 1900)
```
But I also want to look at this stuff as a boxplot

# Subsetting the data

However, as I noted earlier that I included two different types of children's institution, so maybe each have different trends. To examine them separately I can use subset them by time

```{r}
NAB = subset(child, 
             Instit_Type == "NAB")
EAO = subset(child, 
             Instit_Type == "O")
```

So now I can look at them separately, plotting distance per year for each institution

```{r}
plot(NAB$Distance_KM ~ NAB$Year, 
     main = "Distance from urban area vs. year for Native American boarding schools")
abline(lm(NAB$Distance_KM~NAB$Year), 
       col = "red")

plot(EAO$Distance_KM~EAO$Year, 
     main = "Distance from urban area vs. year for Orphanages")
abline(lm(EAO$Distance_KM~EAO$Year), 
       col = "red")
```

This view looks like there may be some increasing trends but there are some significant outliers. Looking at the R-squared for those trend lines

```{r}
summary(lm(NAB$Distance_KM ~ NAB$Year))
summary(lm(EAO$Distance_KM ~ EAO$Year))
```

# Removing outliers

The r-squared values are still really low and my p-values are not significant. So it might be useful to remove the outliers. However, it doesn't look like they have outliers at the same distance so for the orphanages I'm only going to look at ones that were less than 50 km, which removes two of my locations, while for Native American boarding schools I looked at ones that were less than 100 km. 

```{r}
NAB_no = subset(NAB, NAB$Distance_KM < 100)
EAO_no = subset(EAO, EAO$Distance_KM < 50)
```

Then I re-plot them

```{r}
plot(NAB_no$Distance_KM~NAB_no$Year, 
     main = "Distance from urban area vs. year for Native American boarding schools, No Outliers")
abline(lm(NAB_no$Distance_KM ~ NAB_no$Year), 
       col = "red")

plot(EAO_no$Distance_KM~EAO_no$Year, 
     main = "Distance from urban area vs. year for Orphanages, No outliers")
abline(lm(EAO_no$Distance_KM ~ EAO_no$Year), 
       col = "red")
```

So some trends, perhaps ones I'm not very happy with considering one of them is negative , but lets look at a summary of the regression lines: 

```{r}
summary(lm(NAB_no$Distance_KM ~ NAB_no$Year))
summary(lm(EAO_no$Distance_KM ~ EAO_no$Year))
```
